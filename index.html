   <p><strong>Article:</strong> <br> The genocide in Bangladesh began on 25 March 1971 with the launch of Operation Searchlight,[5] as the government of Pakistan, dominated by West Pakistan, began a military crackdown on East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to suppress Bengali calls for self-determination.[6] During the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, members of the Pakistan Armed Forces and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami[7] killed between 300,000 and 3,000,000[1][4][8] people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bengali women,[8][9][10] in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.[11][12] The Government of Bangladesh states 3,000,000 people were killed during the genocide, making it the largest genocide since the Holocaust during World War II.[13][14][15]

  The actions against women were supported by Pakistan's religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were gonimoter maal (Bengali for "public property").[16] As a result of the conflict, a further eight to ten million people[17] fled the country to seek refuge in neighbouring India. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians were internally displaced[8] out of 70 million.[18] During the war, there was also ethnic violence between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis.[19] Biharis faced reprisals from Bengali mobs and militias,[20] and from 1,000[21] to 150,000[22][23] were killed.

   There is an academic consensus that the events which took place during the Bangladesh Liberation War constituted a genocide;[24] however, there are some scholars and authors who disagree that the killing was a genocide.[25]

  <p>During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, members of the Pakistani military and Razakars raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bengali women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.[1][2][3][4] Most of the rape victims of the Pakistani Army and its allies were Hindu women.[5] Some of these women died in captivity or committed suicide while others moved to India.[6] Imams and Muslim religious leaders declared the women "war booty‚Äù.[7][8] The activists and leaders of Islamic parties are also accused to be involved in the rapes and abduction of women.[8]

    The Pakistani elite believed that Hindus were behind the revolt and that as soon as there was a solution to the "Hindu problem" the conflict would resolve. For Pakistanis, the violence against Hindus was a strategic policy.[9] Muslim Pakistani men believed the sacrifice of Hindu women was needed to fix the national malaise.[10] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Imams and Mullahs supported the rapes by the Pakistani Army and issued fatwas declaring the women war booty. A fatwa from West Pakistan during the war asserted that women taken from Bengali Hindus could be considered war booty.[8][11] Those rapes apparently caused thousands of pregnancies, births of war babies, abortions, infanticide, suicide, and Ostracism of the victims. Recognized as one of the major occurrences of war crimes anywhere,[12] the atrocities ended after surrender of the Pakistani military and supporting Razakar militias.[13][14] Initially India claimed its support for the Mukti Bahini and later intervention was on humanitarian grounds, but after the UN rejected this argument, India claimed intervention was needed to protect its own security,[15][16] and it is now widely seen as a humanitarian move.[17]
    
    During the war, Bengali nationalists also committed mass rape of ethnic Bihari Muslim women, since the Bihari Muslim community supported Pakistan.[18] Indian soldiers as well as Bengali militiamen were also identified as perpetrators of rape by scholar Yasmin Saikia.[19][20] Yasmin Saikia was informed repeatedly in Bangladesh that Pakistani, Bengali, and Bihari men raped Hindu women during the war.[21]
    
    In 2009, almost 40 years after the events of 1971, a report published by the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee of Bangladesh accused 1,597 people of war crimes, including rape. Since 2010 the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has indicted, tried and sentenced several people to life imprisonment or death for their actions during the conflict. The stories of the rape victims have been told in movies and literature, and depicted in art. The rape victims have been recognized as Birangona or "war heroines" by the government of Bangladesh.[22]The term Biragonga was first introduced by Sheikh Mujib in 1971, in an attempt to prevent them from being outcast by the society.
